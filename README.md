================

 An Android-PC PowerPoint controller taht pecifically designed for iGeak smart watch.
 Currently supports all android devices, but fits best in iGeak Watch II, which is designed round.
 
 This repository contains android part code only, a technically very easy implementation of gesture detecture, socket communicating, etc.
 The Windows side is written in C#, integrated in Powerpoint ribbon tab. Code for this part has not been commited yet, cuz I'm lazy.
